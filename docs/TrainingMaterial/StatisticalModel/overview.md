# Overview

**Data analysis** is essential in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. This involves correlating measured data with existing **statistical models**. These math models propose a relationship between two or more variables so that the properties of the model can be compared with those of the experimental system.

It is not possible to know if there is a particular relationship between variables. It is only possible to disprove hypotheses by showing that experimental data does not fit the model. As a result, it is important to test multiple relationships and determine the **best fit**, or the better representation, of the data.

# Regression Model

Given Biopharmaceutical Manufacturingâ€™s inherent reliance on monitoring output in relation to time, a base knowledge of **linear regression** is essential. Linear regression can be defined as the use of a mathematical equation to model the linear relation between **independent and dependent variables**. This is often done by graphing data points and then finding an equation that fits it correctly. This provides the modeler with a way to **anticipate the behavior** of the given process if it were to be repeated in the future. 

Regression models are often applied to Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing in the form of **Cell Culture/Fermentation modeling**. The interaction between **CPPs (Critical Process Parameters)** and **CQAs (Critical Quality Attributes)** can be clearly demonstrated using mathematical models. By taking measurements of CQAs at varying CPP levels, we can graph our data and apply a mathematical model that fits best. This can then be used to **estimate** what the CQA output would be with **CPP inputs** that have not yet been measured.
