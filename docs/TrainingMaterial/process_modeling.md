# Introduction

This lecture is designed specifically for scientists and engineers in the biopharma industry, you’ll explore best practices for translating biopharmaceutical manufacturing data into reliable models and better decisions. Working with academic and industry experts, you’ll acquire strategies for improving manufacturing accuracy, enhancing regulatory efficiency, and refining bioprocess operations by using mechanistic, statistical and machine learning models.

## Mechanistic and Statistical Model
Digital twins of bioprocesses can be accomplished with statistical or mechanistic models. It is essential to consider the differences, since both modeling concepts have their pros and cons. In a nutshell:

- Mechanistic models are based on the fundamental laws of natural sciences. Physical and biochemical principles constitute the model equations. Few experimental data is needed to calibrate the model and determine unknown model parameters, such as adsorption coefficients, diffusivity or material properties. An essential benefit of mechanistic vs. statistical models is that the model parameters have an actual physical meaning, which facilitates the scientific interpretation of the results.
- Statistical approaches like big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence utilize statistics to predict trends and patterns. All these models learn from experience provided in the form of data. The more the experience, the better the model will be. Statistical models are, however, bound to their calibration range and can only predict results within the data space they are calibrated from. In particular, they do not allow any major change in the process set-up. Since they are based on correlation and not causality, statistical models are actually a black box and do not provide any mechanistic process understanding.

## Purpose of Modeling

The efficiency of biopharmaceutical manufacturing systems requires drastic improvement in:

* Shortening lead times.

* Reducing waste and failures.

* Improving the quality of final products to meet regulatory standards.

Modeling the processes of manufacturing biopharmaceutical products gives insight into the inner workings of the unit operations and production outputs. This can be used to analyze and make decisions that will better the production overall. This includes:

Analyzing how the complex relationships between critical parameters will affect the output and to what extent

Predicting the quality of the output based on given inputs
