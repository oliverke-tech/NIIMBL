# Overview

Mechanism models, also known as first principle models, utilize differential and partial differential equations and biochemical knowledge to model the interactions within an operation. In this section, we will study the model as it pertains to **cell culture** and **chromatography**: how it is formulated, what it represents, how it is applied, as well as the model's advantages and limitations.

As introduced in previous modules, the parameters (inputs) that have the most significant effect on the output of the process are called **critical process parameters** (CPPs), and these CPPs ultimately determine the most important measures of the output called **critical quality attributes** (CQAs). Mechanism models aim to model the interaction of these CPPs and their effect on CQAs within an operation by using differential equations.

# **The Use of Mechanism Models**

**Mechanism models** provide an abstract description of underlying mechanisms in the biopharmaceutical process. More specifically, they are used to describe physical interactions like mass transfer, heat transfer, heat flow, and their impact on the chemical reaction taking place using differential equations.

Mechanism models are developed by combining known physical laws with training data and experiential knowledge of the interactions in a given process. These models commonly have many parameters that were adjusted or created to fit existing data. The result is a model that has a basic understanding of the interaction at hand, but helps to describe CPP impact on CQAs.

For example, in the cell culture process, first principles models are used to predict how adjusting something like media flow rate (CPP) has an impact on substrate concentration (CQA) in the yield.

## ****Advantages****

The biggest advantage of first principles models is that a model can be tailored to a specific process layout when defining parameters. The use of test data in the construction of a mechanical model will most accurately model your particular machinery. In addition, first principles models can be used to monitor, control, and optimize the process as itâ€™s running.

## ****Disadvantages****

Mechanical models struggle with accuracy. When creating a mechanical model, attempting to add accuracy can quickly make a model extremely complicated. Adding accuracy adds more parameters to the model, making it harder to interact with the model and get easily measurable results. The construction of a first principles model is also labor intensive and time consuming. Collecting test data and gaining the necessary knowledge to create a mechanical model can use many resources, especially for a model that only returns ballpark results.
