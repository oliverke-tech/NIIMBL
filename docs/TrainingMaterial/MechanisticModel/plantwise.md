In this lecture, we focus on a perfusion biorecator of Pichia pastoris cells, which includes

1. State-of-the-art models in chromatography,
2. Perfusion bioreactors
3. Uuse of models for integrated process simulation and prediction.

The simulation model and implementation is adapted from [1].

# Diagram

In the bioprocessing industry, most work has revolved around modeling unit operations [11]. Models for bioreactors and chromatography  are mature and will be briefly reviewed in the subsequent subsections. However, the unit operations do not operate in isolation, and changing
a unit’s operating conditions will impact downstream processing. This motivates integrated plant models.

# Potential Usage

- Consider integrated perfusion bioreactor and chromatograph purification.
- Conduct long-term predictive analysis, e.g., how the feeding strategy at different times of bioreactor impact on the trajectory and variation of integrated biomanufacturing processes
- Find the optimal and robust control strategies for this integrated process
